I am currently in my fourth year majoring in English Literature and minoring in Digital Humanities. Expecting to graduate shortly in the spring, I hope to explore career options in marketing–seeing that I am the social media manager for a student-run magazine called <em>Pacific Ties </em>and I've had the wonderful opportunity to intern with Digital Media Management here in Los Angeles where I was able to work on the social media for season 4 of <em>The Kardasians</em>, season 3 of <em>The D'amelio Show</em>, and <em>Tell Me Lies </em>on Hulu.</p>",
